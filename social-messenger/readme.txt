== Description ==

Messenger custom chat on your website for free. Modify colors, choose languages, integrate with PolyLang, change positions and much more... It's easy!
Live Chat (Messenger API) is an easy-to-use plugin that helps ordinary users to start Messenger customer chat on their site.

All you have to do is add the ID of your fanpage, which you can find in the Information tab.

NOTE:
Facebook and Facebook Messenger are registered trademarks of Facebook Inc.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.4.0 or greater (PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* WordPress version 4.9.0 or greater (WordPress 4.9.7 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Live Chat (Messenger API), log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type Live Chat (Messenger API) and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our messenger plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our messenger plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.


== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can I do more with this plug than with the official one? =

Yes of course! You can easily change languages, colors, positions, and quickly adjust all settings from the Customizer, and keep watching how settings affect the chat's appearance.

= What are the most common problems? =

1. We found out that if there is another Facebook plugin on your site that uses, for example, an SDK for comments, then the chat will not display properly.
2. Facebook blocked preview of changes live when we're in Customizer (iframe).

= Can I change the chat color? =

Yes, you can change the color of your chat using the plug-in settings

= Can I change the chat language? =

Yes, all available languages offered by Facebook are available (I think)

= Does the plugin support multilingual websites? =

You can integrate with PolyLang with one click

= Does the plugin support many languages? =

This plugin contains a full translation into Polish and English.

= Where can I find the ID of my fanpage? =

The code of your fanpage is at the bottom of the Information section, the link to this section looks like this:
facebook.com/pg/rapiddev/about/

= Do the creators of the plugin collect any information about me? =

No, by adding live chat to your website, you also create your own Api ID. The chat only works on your site.

= Do I have to take any more steps? =

You must add your site to trusted in the settings of your fanpage.

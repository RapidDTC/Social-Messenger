Facebook Messenger on your website. Modify colors, choose languages, integrate with PolyLang, change positions and much more... It's easy!
Social Messenger is an easy-to-use plugin that helps ordinary users to start Facebook Messenger on their site.

All you have to do is add the application API, which you can find on the site for developers from Facebook and the ID of your fanpage, which you can find in the Information tab.

NOTE:
Facebook and Facebook Messenger are registered trademarks of Facebook Inc.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.4.0 or greater (PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* WordPress version 4.9.0 or greater (WordPress 4.9.7 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Facebook Messenger (Live Chat), log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type Facebook Messenger (Live Chat) and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our messenger plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our messenger plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
